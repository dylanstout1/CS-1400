<h1>Week 5 Research Topic<h1>
<p>During the summer I really like to go boating. Anytime I can get out on the water I’ll take it. My favorite part of boating is wake surfing. I only started doing this a few years ago and already I’m better than a lot of my friends that have been doing it for a lot longer than me. There is just something about going out with some friends and spending a day on the lake.</p>

<p>I also love to play baseball with all my friends. Anytime we can we’ll go out and play baseball for hours and hours.  Normally I’ll play 1st basemen and I love it so much. I’ve been playing baseball basically all my life.  At one point I was probably the worse batter in the world because I was afraid of the ball. Now I’m a lot better and not afraid of the ball. I’m just waiting for the day that I hit a homerun in a game</p>
